In other words is defines the percentage of the mix in which the reverb will be applied.", "This is a pan slider. A pan slider defines form which speaker the sound will be heard. If the pan is -1 the sound will be heard from the left speaker and if it is 1 it will be heard from the right speaker", "This is a delay slider defining the dry-wet mix. It's values range from 0 to 1, where 0 means that no delay is applied to the mix and 1 that delay is applied to the whole mix (wet signal)", "The last section of th app's layout is the reverb presets options. This section consists of buttons, each one of them simulates how the mix would be heard in various different rooms.", "Finally if the same button is pressde  2 times, the second time the sound stops playing and if tou press it again,  it starts playing and looping"]
